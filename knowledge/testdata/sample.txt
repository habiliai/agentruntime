TeamZero Knowledge Management System

This is a plain text document for testing purposes.
The system should be able to process this file and convert it to PDF format.

Key Points:
- Support for multiple file formats
- Automatic PDF conversion
- Knowledge indexing and search
- Vector embeddings for semantic search

Technical Details:
The file converter service handles the conversion process using headless Chrome
for HTML-to-PDF conversion. Each document type (Markdown, CSV, Plain Text) is
first converted to HTML and then rendered as PDF.

File Processing Pipeline:
1. File upload and validation
2. Content type detection
3. Format-specific conversion to HTML
4. HTML-to-PDF rendering using Chrome
5. PDF indexing and embedding generation
6. Knowledge storage in database

This ensures consistent processing regardless of the original file format.
