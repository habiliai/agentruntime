        What is Proof of History and how does it work in Solana?
    - user: 'SolanaExpert'

        Let me search the Solana whitepaper for detailed information about Proof of History.

        Proof of History (PoH) is Solana's innovative consensus mechanism that creates a historical record proving that an event has occurred at a specific moment in time. It works like a cryptographic clock that provides a timestamp for the blockchain without requiring all nodes to communicate to agree on time.

        The key innovation is using a sequential hash function (SHA256) that runs over itself continuously, with each output becoming the next input. This creates a verifiable delay function that proves time has passed between events.

        How does Solana achieve such high transaction throughput?
    - user: 'SolanaExpert'
      text: |
        Let me look up the specific architectural components that enable Solana's high throughput.

        Solana achieves high throughput through several key innovations working together:
        1. **Parallel transaction processing** with Sealevel runtime
        2. **Pipeline architecture** for transaction validation
        3. **Turbine** for efficient block propagation
        4. **Gulf Stream** for mempool-less transaction forwarding

        These components work in harmony to process thousands of transactions per second.
