# RSS Tools Configuration Guide

This rule provides patterns and best practices for configuring RSS tools in AgentRuntime agents.

## RSS Tool Implementation
RSS tools are implemented in [tool/rss.go](mdc:tool/rss.go) and provide two main functions:
- `search_rss` - AI agents use this to search across multiple RSS feeds for specific topics
- `read_rss` - AI agents use this to read all recent items from a single RSS feed

## Configuration Pattern
RSS tools must be configured as native tools in the agent's skills section:

```yaml
skills:
  - type: nativeTool
    name: rss  # Can be any descriptive name
    description: Search and read RSS feeds for current information
    env:
      allowed_feed_urls:
        - url: https://feeds.npr.org/1001/rss.xml
          name: NPR Top Stories
          description: Latest news and stories from NPR
        - url: https://feeds.bbci.co.uk/news/rss.xml
          name: BBC News
          description: Latest news from BBC
```

## Required Fields
Each RSS feed in `allowed_feed_urls` must have:
- `url` (string, required) - The RSS feed URL
- `name` (string, required) - Human-readable name for the feed
- `description` (string, required) - Clear description of the feed's content

## Best Practices

### Feed Selection
- Choose reputable sources relevant to your agent's purpose
- Group feeds by category (news, tech, research, etc.)
- Consider feed volume - high-volume feeds work better with search_rss

### Descriptions
Write clear, specific descriptions that help the AI agent understand the feed content:
```yaml
# Good: Specific and informative
- url: https://feeds.feedburner.com/techcrunch
  name: TechCrunch
  description: Technology news, startup funding, Silicon Valley updates, and tech industry analysis

# Avoid: Vague descriptions
- url: https://feeds.feedburner.com/techcrunch
  name: TechCrunch
  description: Tech stuff
```

### System Prompts
Configure agents to use RSS tools effectively:
```yaml
system: |
  You are a news monitoring agent with access to current news feeds.
  
  When users ask about current events or specific topics:
  1. Use search_rss to find relevant articles across multiple sources
  2. Use read_rss to get general updates from specific sources
  3. Always cite your sources and include publication dates
  4. Provide context and summaries, not just raw headlines
```

## Example Configurations

### News Monitoring Agent
See [examples/news_monitor.agent.yaml](mdc:examples/news_monitor.agent.yaml) for a complete example.

### Startup News Agent
See [examples/startup_news_agent.yaml](mdc:examples/startup_news_agent.yaml) for startup-focused RSS configuration.

## Testing RSS Configuration
Reference the RSS tools guide in [docs/rss-tools.md](mdc:docs/rss-tools.md) for comprehensive testing approaches.

## Common Issues
- Ensure `type: nativeTool` is set correctly
- Verify RSS feed URLs are accessible and return valid XML
- Include clear instructions in system prompts for RSS tool usage
- Test with different question types to verify agent behavior
